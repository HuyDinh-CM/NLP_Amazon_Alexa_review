# NLP Project: Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Alexa Reviews

### Overview:
Our NLP project focuses on the sentiment analysis of customer reviews about Amazon Alexa. The goal is to build an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict sentiment levels from customer reviews of Amazon Echo products. By automating the sentiment analysis process, we want to provide valuable information on customer satisfaction.

### Target:

- Build and train an AI model to analyze the emotions of Amazon Alexa reviews.
- Categorize reviews into positive, negative, or neutral emotional categories.
- Provide an automated tool to predict customer satisfaction with products.
- Facilitate the efficient analysis of a large number of customer reviews.

### Tools and Technology:

- Google Colab notebooks for development and testing.
- Python programming language.
- Scikit-learn library to implement NLP algorithms and build emotional analysis models.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization.

### Data sources:
The data for this project was collected from Kaggle, including real customer [reviews of Amazon Alexa Echo products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews). This dataset provides a range of different emotions expressed by customers.

### Expected results:
I aim to build an accurate and reliable AI model to analyze emotions in Amazon Alexa reviews. This model automatically categorizes reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories, helping to provide helpful information for decisions within the company. And this project will bring positive contributions and help improve the efficiency of customer reviews.
